# Wormhole Mock
This is my attempt at making a jank [Wormhole](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole) mock in order to better understand Wormhole transactions between different blockchains. 

Blockchains I have looked at so far:

- Ethereum/BNB
- Solana

Useful Links so far:

- [Tenderly for Ethereum](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/)
